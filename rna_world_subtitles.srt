Four billion years ago… Earth was a boiling wasteland.

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
No DNA. No proteins. But from this chaos, life may have emerged—through RNA.

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The RNA world hypothesis suggests that before DNA and proteins, life was based solely on RNA.

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let’s simulate it in Python. We create RNA molecules with random sequences.

5
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If the sequence contains 'AUG', it can replicate, with a small chance of mutation.
