Discover how life might have begun — not with DNA or proteins, but with RNA. In this video, we explore the RNA world hypothesis using simple Python simulations that model self-replicating molecules, mutations, spatial environments, and more.

Chapters:
0:00 Intro – The Origin of Life
0:45 What is the RNA World?
2:00 Python Simulation: Simple RNA Evolution
3:30 Grid Simulation: RNA in Space
5:00 Could This Lead to Life?
6:00 Outro
